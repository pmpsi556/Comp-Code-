This code was my first project in python. I used an Alphavantage API to recive the info, it allows you to import the data into a CSV file. Although limited in what it displays, I will be adding more to it. I started this project when I was the President of the Charleston Southern Univeristy SMIF (Student Managed Investment Fund) in order to help students complete comps anylsis more efficently. Students liked the program however it does need work in its current state. I created this about a year ago and will now want to use it for Baruchs Masters SMIF, Dog Bone Capital, which I am currently the VP of. Ideally this program will allow students to complate comps analysis more quickly. Jan 31st 2026.
